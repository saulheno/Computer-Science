    <h2>The Facilities</h2>
    <p>
        The college is spread across multiple Campus'. We are in the process <br>
        of moving almost everything to our new, state of the art Campus in Grangegorman <br>
        Due to the ongoing pandemic, learning is almost entirely remote, with a select few <br>
        attending labs and other practical classes, mostly in our old campus on Kevin Street. <br>
        <br>
        Despite the setbacks with our move to Grangegorman, our facilities in our current Campus', <br>
        both Kevin and Aungier Street, are still modern and fully featured and will make for a great <br>
        tool for learning.
