User Manual for the Shopping Cart program

When the program is run, a set of 5 options is presented to the user.
Nothing may be done until option 1 is fully completed and a user is created.
There are two options for Customer Type.
	Loyal has access to exclusive items while Bargain Hunter does not.
During option one, you are prompted for a "Region". This is the region code for your country.
For instance, Europe is 'EU', North America is 'NA', Australia is 'AUS' etc

Option 2 lists the products available to you, with their price, PID etc.

Option 3 Allows you to add or remove a product to the cart. Note only products you are eligible to 
buy are able to be added. 
Removing a product is only possible once that product already exists in the cart.

Option 4 lets you see the current cart and the items it holds, as well as the total value

Option 5 shows you your current basket and allows you to checkout and exit.

Finally, Option 0. This is not listed, as it is a developer tool. Once option 0 is selected, you
are prompted for Loyal or Bargain Hunter, and then for Underage or Overage. 
After these have been picked, the Customer is generate automatically, and it runs through every 
option of the menu to ensure the system functions.
